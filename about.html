      <h1 class="about">The story of my photography passion.</h1>
      <p>
        I was born and raised with a huge love for the beauty of nature and i
        was always searching on ways to capture its beauty and photography gave
        me the means to achieve that. Since a child i was riding my bycicle with
        my camera for search of that beautiful site and the perfect moment to
        capture it,this could lead me bycicling kilometers and reaching places i
        havent been before but that was ok in achieving my goal.After,when the
        years past and i was able to actually travel,i continue the same routine
        on travelling and taking photos of the places that made my heart happy.
